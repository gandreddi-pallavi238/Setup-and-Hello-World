## Week 1: Setup and Hello World
Overview

This repository contains the projects completed during Week 1 of my mobile app development internship. The week focused on setting up the development environment, understanding the basic structure of Android applications, and learning to work with UI components and layouts.

The repository includes:

Hello World App – A simple application to test the development setup and understand the app lifecycle.

Personal Info App – A mini-project that displays the user’s name, photo, and contact details, demonstrating the use of basic UI elements and layout design.

## Key Features

Environment Setup: Installation and configuration of Android Studio, SDKs, and emulator/device testing.

Basic UI Components: Implementation of buttons, text fields, and images.

Layout Design: Understanding LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, and ConstraintLayout to organize UI elements.

Styling: Customizing colors, fonts, and themes to enhance the app appearance.

Mini Project: Integration of learned concepts to create a simple functional app.

Challenges Faced

Configuring Android Studio and SDK due to compatibility issues.

Understanding project structure and file hierarchy.

Running the emulator and testing apps initially caused errors.

Aligning UI elements and customizing layouts required extra practice.

Getting Started

To run these projects:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/gandreedipallavi/week1-setup-helloworld.git


Open the project in Android Studio.

Build and run the app on an emulator or connected Android device.

## Purpose

These projects serve as an introduction to mobile app development, focusing on basic app creation, UI design, and testing. They lay the foundation for more advanced app development tasks in the upcoming weeks.
